## CO2 Emission Prediction using Google Colab and Python

### Overview:
This project demonstrates how to predict CO2 emissions using machine learning models and visualize the results on a Choropleth map. We use historical CO2 emissions data, apply a regression model for prediction, and then create interactive visualizations to display the emissions data across countries.

### Project Components:
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The dataset contains CO2 emissions data from various countries over a period of years. This data typically includes information like the country name, year, and the CO2 emission value (usually in metric tons).

2. **Modeling CO2 Emissions**:
   - A regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) is used to predict future CO2 emissions based on past data. This model learns the relationship between the years and the corresponding emissions levels.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - We use **Plotly** to create an interactive **Choropleth map**, which allows you to visualize the predicted CO2 emissions by country. The map is color-coded to show the intensity of emissions, with countries having higher emissions being highlighted in different shades.

### Steps to Run the Project:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   Install necessary Python libraries such as **Plotly**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**. These libraries will help in data manipulation, model building, and visualization.

2. **Load the Dataset**:  
   Import the CO2 emissions dataset (usually in CSV format) into the Google Colab environment. The dataset should contain country-wise emissions data over several years.

3. **Preprocess the Data**:  
   Clean the dataset by handling missing values, converting categorical data (e.g., country names) into numerical representations, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Train the Model**:  
   Use a regression algorithm to train the model with historical data. A simple Linear Regression model can predict future emissions based on past trends.

5. **Visualize the Data**:  
   Using Plotly’s **Choropleth map**, plot the predicted CO2 emissions across countries. The map will use color gradients to represent different emission levels, allowing for a clear visual comparison between countries.

6. **Evaluate the Model**:  
   After training, evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well the model is making predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing or invalid data and prepares it for model training.
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes machine learning to predict future CO2 emissions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays predictions on a Choropleth map for easy comparison.
- **Scalable**: This process can be adapted for any country or dataset with CO2 emissions data.

### Technologies Used:
- **Google Colab**: For cloud-based development.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the prediction model.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations like the Choropleth map.
 Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Google Colab** (or any Python environment)
- Required Python Libraries:
  - **pandas**
  - **numpy**
  - **plotly**
  - **scikit-learn**

 Dataset:
You can use datasets like the **World Bank CO2 emissions dataset** or any similar dataset that provides CO2 emissions data by country over time.
