CO2 Emission Prediction with Choropleth Visualization
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future CO2 emissions while also visualizing the geographical distribution of CO2 emissions worldwide. By using Choropleth maps, we can effectively visualize the level of CO2 emissions for different countries, helping to understand global emissions patterns. The project combines machine learning prediction models with geospatial visualization techniques to provide insights into emission trends across the globe.

Key Components
Data Collection: The dataset used in this project contains historical data on CO2 emissions by country, along with various factors that influence emissions such as GDP, energy consumption, and population size.

Choropleth Maps: Choropleth maps are used to visualize CO2 emissions at the country level. They allow for an easy comparison of emissions across different regions, highlighting countries with the highest and lowest CO2 emissions.

Data Preprocessing: Similar to the previous approach, data preprocessing steps involve:

Handling missing data
Normalizing or scaling numerical features
Extracting relevant features (e.g., CO2 emissions by year, GDP, energy usage)
CO2 Emission Prediction: A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression) is trained on historical CO2 emission data and other relevant variables. The model is then used to predict future CO2 emissions based on trends.

Geographical Visualization Using Choropleth: The choropleth map is generated using Plotly, which provides an interactive way to visualize data on a world map. Each country is colored according to its level of CO2 emissions, making it easy to identify countries with the highest and lowest emissions.

Example of a Choropleth Map in the Project:

Countries are colored based on their CO2 emissions per capita or total CO2 emissions.
The map uses color intensity (e.g., a gradient from green to red) to show higher emissions with darker colors and lower emissions with lighter colors.
Plotly for Interactive Visualizations: Plotly is used for creating dynamic and interactive maps that users can zoom into, hover over for more details, and explore geographical patterns in CO2 emissions.
